Begining my own music and video player from the ground.

Project is availible and known as [Tubik](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tgs.tubik) in Play Market.

It supports last.fm, spaces.ru, Youtube, vk.com API integrations.

But this new version will come with such support slowly in future, so please be patiant to wait for them.

Started to open source this - like [Shuttle (git)](https://github.com/timusus/Shuttle) player with one goal - to 'give feedback' and help from other developers to give new breathe.

In past my success story was assigned to creation of [zaycev.net Media Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.p74.player) [history](https://habrahabr.ru/post/283274/)

But for this days and new way I've created this one.

To start you must have now API_KEY and SECRET_KEY to last.fm service.

#### History:

Tubik started in winter of 2015. And before it also was named as 'ABC Music'.

I'm tried to find some investors or people from Media Groups that allow use for legal any music streams - but without success.

There is also [some description](http://tgsoft.in/tubik/) of functionality
